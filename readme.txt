*Providing WordPress Integrated Insurance Quotations*

Welcome to the OpenQuote plugin for WordPress.  Created by Applied Industrial Logic, this component allows you to integrate OpenQuote insurance product quotations into any Wordpress 3 website.  This plugin is licenced under the same GPL terms and conditions as the OpenQuote software.

**OpenQuote**

OpenQuote is an open source system, created by Applied Industrial Logic to help reduce both the time-to-market and costs of web-enabling quotations for insurance products and schemes.  The software allows insurers, brokers and agents to efficiently release and maintain their products by configuring risk capture, risk assessment and rating rules.
OpenQuote can be configured to work for any line of business, it uses business rules (risk evaluation and rates) that can be set up in Excel spreadsheets. Many different insurance products can be run and controlled from OpenQuote at any one time.
The system can be made available to brokers or directly to proposers, quotes can be made and saved for the broker or proposer to return to at a later date. OpenQuote can also issue documentation to the broker or proposer, whilst keeping the Underwriter informed about all quotations and when they are accepted.
From a technical perspective OpenQuote is a Java EE based server side system (this means it needs to be hosted on a server running a Java application server), user access to the system is via any internet browser.&nbsp; Using web services and portal technology OpenQuote can be integrated into third party applications.&nbsp; For more technical information please visit the OpenQuote community site: [OpenQuote](openquote.opensourceinsurance.org).
